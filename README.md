Tired of Windows 10 messing up your desktop icon positions when using multiple monitors?

This small 80x80 transparent PNG can be used to fix the issue until Microsoft does. The trick is to have at least 1 file/shortcut on every monitor you use.

Just place the PNG (or a shortcut to it) on the monitors you're not using for your actual desktop shortcuts. It is transparent and can be unobtrusively placed in one of the lower corners.
